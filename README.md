# Pit Stop
Pit Stop is a travel journal web application that changes the way users remember their trips. Instead of creating daily journal entries, users add places they visited on a trip and create reflections on those places. This was inspired by the idea of [memory space (Les Lieux de MÃ©moire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_space_(social_science)) in that our memories are often tied to the places we have been.

## Features

### Password Authentication
 * Validate current users and keep them logged in using JWT
 * Authenticate users' passwords with BCrypt
 
### Account
 * log into the application 
 * sign up to create an account
 * remain logged in if they never logged out
 * security: need to input the correct password in order to have access to the update account form
 
### Trips
 * create a new trip
 * see all of their trips
 * update information about a trip
 * delete a trip
 
### Map 
 * see a map with markers of all the places they visited on a trip
 * click on a marker will open a pop up of information for a place and center the marker on the viewport
 * close a popup with the escape key or clicking on the 'x' button
 * use geolocation to see where you are
 * see the latitude, longitude, and zoom on the map
 * navigation controls: the map can be full-screen and zoom control

### Places
 * see cards of all the places they visited on a trip
 * labels on the cards of their category and if they would revisit or not
 * can search places by name, filter by category, and filter by if they would revisit or not
 * the result(s) of the searched/filtered places are reflected on both the cards of places and the markers on the map
 * add a place and can use your current location for the latitude and longitude
 * update a place's information
 * deleting a place deletes their card as well as their marker from the map

### Reflections
 * see all reflections for a place
 * add reflections for a place
 * validation that a reflection's rating must be between 0 - 10
 * add a image to a reflection
 * update a reflection
 * delete a reflection
 
 ### Active Record Associations
 * There are 5 models that have the following associations ```has_many``` and ```belongs_to ```
